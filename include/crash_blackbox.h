// A tiny "flight recorder" for diagnosing sudden watchdog/panic reboots
// (issue #362: long-uptime "Stop working" -> Interrupt Watchdog reset).
//
// The reset reason says "Interrupt Watchdog" but the WebUI log ring buffer
// (in RAM) does not survive the reboot, and CONFIG_ESP_COREDUMP_ENABLE_TO_NONE
// is set (the 4 MB flash is full — no room for a coredump partition). So
// without a serial console attached at crash time there is NO backtrace and
// NO heap snapshot, making the crash effectively undiagnosable.
//
// This black box lives in RTC slow memory (RTC_NOINIT_ATTR), which is preserved
// across software/watchdog/panic resets and only wiped on power-loss. The
// heap watchdog task writes a fresh sample every cycle; after a crash the next
// boot reads the last sample and surfaces it in the reset-reason diagnostic
// field, so we can finally tell whether heap exhaustion preceded the reset.
//
// This is intentionally minimal (no backtrace) because it needs no extra flash
// partition and is safe to ship on the stable devices. Once a crash yields a
// low-heap sample we know the direction; a full coredump can be added later by
// shrinking another partition.

// Op-tag flight recorder: names the blocking operation in flight, if any,
// at the moment of an Interrupt-Watchdog/panic reset. This is what actually
// answers "what was the firmware doing" for issue #362 — the periodic heap
// sample above only bounds the picture (rules out slow heap exhaustion), it
// cannot name a specific call site.
//
// Both tracked domains already have a single project-wide serialization
// primitive (NvsStorageLock's recursive mutex; g_net_fetch_mutex, a plain
// binary semaphore), so at most one task ever owns a domain's tag at a time.
// That makes plain (unlocked) RTC writes from crash_blackbox_*_op_begin/end
// race-free by construction: only the current owner of the underlying mutex
// ever writes its domain's slot. The NVS domain uses a small stack because
// the recursive mutex lets its owning task nest calls; the net-fetch domain
// is a single slot because that semaphore never nests.
